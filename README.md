This project utilizes the Visual Crossing API to fetch real-time weather data and display it on a website. By sending a request to the API, we retrieve the weather information in JSON format. The project focuses on learning how to handle API responses, particularly in JSON, and how to send this data to JavaScript for dynamic rendering on the webpage. This enables users to view up-to-date weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and forecast information. The project enhances understanding of working with APIs, parsing JSON data, and integrating it seamlessly into a web application.
